## Artist Statement

As I transition from experimentation with living systems to non-living systems, I am exploring the thermodynamic similarities between the two, bringing the laboratory into the studio. My understanding of clay chemistry originates from procedures to correct so-called ceramic faults. I apply these suggested corrections in the opposite way, poking fun at the limits imposed by traditional functional ceramics. The result is a lab-created, fire-activated Goo that expands, encases, and consumes its surroundings. The Gooâ€™s search for stability is now a preserved moment in time, showcasing these ceramic faults.

My work is a continuously evolving experiment, each discovery driving the next. I find enjoyment in the unknown and embrace the chance of failure that comes with the process of experimentation.
